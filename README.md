## 2. Font

Nirmala UI supports Meetei Mayek by default in windows. But it is preferred to download and install [Noto Sans Meetei Mayek](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Meetei+Mayek) from Google Fonts.

## 3. BONUS: Bengali Keymap (Windows Default)

Since Meiteilon was typed in Bengali, given below is the Keymap to type bengali characters using QWERTY keyboard.
